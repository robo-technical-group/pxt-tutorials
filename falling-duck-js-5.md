# Falling Duck JavaScript Level 5

## Falling Duck! @showdialog

Enjoy building the Level 5 version of *Falling Duck*!

*   In level 1, we had two sets of log images selected with an
``||logic(noclick):if-else||`` statement.
*   In level 2, we restructured the code to make it easier to add new log images.   
We also added an animation to the duck sprite when it is flying upward.
*   In level 3, we added multiple levels to the game. As the player scores points,
the game will increase in difficulty by making logs appear more quickly.
*   In level 4, we allowed the player to select an initial 
difficulty level. This difficulty level influences the speed
of the projectiles and the acceleration of the player's fall.
*   In level 5, we will customize the high scores routine.

Have fun!
